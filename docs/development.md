# Development and validation

Run the cross-provider packaging checks:

```bash
npm test
```

With Claude Code installed, run both strict Claude validators:

```bash
npm run validate:claude
```

With `uv` and the Codex plugin development skills installed, run the shared
OpenAI package validator:

```bash
npm run validate:openai
```

The command uses the `plugin-creator` validator bundled with the installed
Codex development skills and succeeds only when it exits with status `0`.
Record `codex --version` with release validation results so the validator's
host revision is explicit without copying or pinning that external validator
inside this repository.

Provider release versions live in their respective plugin manifests and can
advance without changing the other package.
